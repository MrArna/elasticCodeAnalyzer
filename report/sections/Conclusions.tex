\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a new approach to analyze git patches and bugs based on Machine Learning techniques. We demonstrated how we can obtain some meaningful results even by implementing a simple system with several limitations. We mentioned that our system can be easily extended to obtain much more interesting results. As a future work, we intend to improve our system's capabilities to see whether we are, indeed, able to detect more useful patterns.
